    "PyTorch is a framework similar to Numpy but with more \"muscles.\" The main reason why we wish to use it here is that it has an efficient implementation of [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), i.e., we can define a \"forward\" computation and PyTorch can compute the gradients for us.\n",

The network captures 34 members of a karate club, documenting links between pairs of members who interacted outside the club. During the study a conflict arose between the administrator \"John A\" and instructor \"Mr. Hi\" (pseudonyms), which led to the split of the club into two. Half of the members formed a new club around Mr. Hi; members from the other part found a new instructor or gave up karate.
